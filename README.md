Protein function prediction for poorly annotated species

Code to annotate genes to GO terms and calculate Area Under the Curve (AUC) using a Positive Unlabeled version of a Bayesian Markov Random Field (PU-BMRF). Network data used was co-expression data and protein-protein intercation from humans, yeast, and chickens.
