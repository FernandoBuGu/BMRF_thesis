Highest average AUC was (0.76), lower than (0.81) in paper plos-one and than with ppi data (0.82) using previous code.

Some remarks:
Results are better when the proportion of GOs in the test set is small (20% vs 50%).
Including only (biological processes) GOs seems to improve the performance
In large networks, including in train GOs terms others than those with EES, seems to improve the performance; whereas in small networks, the opposites seems true (see results S2 and S3)
High threshold of minGOsize is often better
When the number of conexions was 10973 (very small network), an AUC of 0.71 was achieved, although in that case only 3 GO terms were used to compute AUC. For networks of ~26000 conexions, an AUC of ~0.68 was achieved for a reasonable number of GOs.    

Conclussions:
Performance does not seem to be high enough how to obtain good results in smaller networks.
